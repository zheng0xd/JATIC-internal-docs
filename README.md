# gitlab pages project template

This is a gitlab template for a minimal project with a gitlab pages deployment.

The URL for the associated gitlab page can be found in `.mkdocs/mkdocs.yml` as the `site_url:` value.
your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.
