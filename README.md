# default project template

This is a gitlab template for a minimal project with a built in gitlab pages config. This allows you to turn your gitlab project into a lightweight website extremely easily.

In order to set up your website, edit `.mkdocs/mkdocs.yml` to suit your project, then commit.

After setting up, you can find your website URL by navigating in the gitlab project to "Deploy / Pages".
