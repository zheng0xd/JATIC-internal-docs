# Agile Development Approach

Section to be completed: software project management plan.

## Agile software development

JATIC software will be developed with an Agile approach. The following principles will govern the high-level software development framework:

1. Constant focus on delivery of value to users
2. Continual re-evaluation of direction to best deliver value, with regular re-alignment of tasks with capability need
3. Rapid and regular delivery of working code
4. Transparent, open, and frequent communication between all teams working on program, including government, FFRDCs, and vendors
5. Open access to code between all teams working on program, including all vendors
6. Use of modern software development methodologies (e.g., Scrum, DevSecOps) and tools (e.g., Slack, Confluence, Kanban, Git, Jenkins)

All vendors will utilize an Agile software development approach, with ability to tailor to particular preferences in methodology and experience. All JATIC vendors will employ agile development methods such as:

- All vendors will operate on two week sprints, with all vendors delivering code on the same week.
- daily collaboration between Government and contractor teams
- mutually agreed-upon definition of “done” for each sprint/release cycle
- metrics informing the Government about the quality of capability developed and delivered

The government, in consultation with government sponsors through the User Agreements, will have full control of prioritizing the product backlog and managing the development process to ensure software aligns with architecture, vision, and other development activities.

## Iterative value delivery cycle

The iterative value delivery cycle operates on multiple time frames at once. We will establish the short-, medium-, and long-term time frames as < 1 month, multiple months, > 1 year, respectively. The types of value delivery are referenced from Value Statement from Capability Descripition.

On the medium- to long-term time frame, software capabilities may be created or extended to support new T&E dimensions, AI tasks, or mission use cases. These tasks can greatly vary in scope and the amount of work needed. As an example lower bound, it may be take a few weeks or a month to extend a T&E capability from regular imagery to satellite imagery formats, which include multiple magnifications. As an example upper bound, it may take a year or longer to create capabilities for adversarial AI T&E of natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, because there may be almost no overlap with the CV counterpart.

Also on the medium- to long-term time frame, software capabilities may be integrated with large technologies and deployed on large, complex DoD environments. Technologies requiring extensive integration may be large platforms such as Sagemaker or Databricks, or frameworks such as TensorFlow or Pytorch. Large DoD environments include enterprise solutions such as ADVANA or integration into sensitive environments.

On the short- to medium-term time frame, software capabilities may be extended with smaller T&E functions, or integrated into smaller technologies.

Continuously, software will be pushed to increase ease of use, user experience, performance, cybersecurity, and productization.

Within the Agile time frames, *Initiatives* will be defined as a set of long- and medium-term objectives. An *Epic* will focus on the delivery of a major milestone or component of a long- or medium-term objective, or the delivery of a short-term objective.

The long-term objectives, such as the AI task, T&E dimension, and the environments / large technologies with which to integrate, will be determined as high-level requirements to vendors before beginning work. Objectives on shorter time frames will have more flexibility, with greater ability to re-prioritize to meet user or mission needs, or to implement the best solution.
