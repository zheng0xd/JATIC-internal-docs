## Open-source solutions

Software designed for T&E requires transparency of code implementation in order to foster trust in the computed results. Thus, the software solutions developed to support JATIC must have source code which is at least openly accessible by the Government.

JATIC will leverage existing open-source solutions as a starting place for some of its components, especially when the open-source components are widely used and recognized. In these cases, JATIC will provide providing productization, maturity, transition, and deployment on top of the existing solution in order provide a mature product across the Department. JATIC will strive to make many of their capabilities publicly available.

## Commercial solutions

JATIC will leverage existing commercial solutions, insofar as the solutions meet the above capability requirement of code accessibility for the Government. JATIC software will generally avoid commercial solutions offering T&E capacities "as a service" in order to maintain transparency of code.

## Innovation & evolution

The program will collaborate with organizations in the DoD doing Science & Technology (S&T) research, including DARPA, DIU, TRMC, and the Service Labs, in order to transition prototype capabilities. In addition, because of the team's close interactions and feedback loop with AI T&E tool users, the team will inform S&T organizations on critical research directions in order to best meet capability needs.

JATIC will transition prototypes from TRL 5-6 to TRL 8-10 to be made available as mature products across the DoD.
