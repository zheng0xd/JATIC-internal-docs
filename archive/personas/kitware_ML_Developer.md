# Persona: ML Developer

## Role and Background

<!--What's their name and role?-->
<!--What's their experience with AI, AI T&E, or other relevant domains? What other skills do they bring to the table?-->

- Name: Luna
- Role: DoD Contractor
- Education: Ph.D. in Computer Science
- Experience: Extensive computer vision research background

## Mission and Goals

<!--What is the mission that they are working on?-->
<!--What is the AI modality and use case(s) that they are working on?-->
<!--What are the models and/or datasets that they are working with?>
<!--What is their role on this project? What task are they trying to achieve?-->

Luna is working on aircraft object detection in satellite imagery. She plans to do large-scale model training and comparison, and wants to create a model that is generalizable to operational data which may be slightly different than her training data. Some of the challenges she faces include handling imbalanced object classes (e.g. few examples of rare classes of aircraft) and a requirement to assess both the adversarial and natural robustness of her models.

## Preferences and Challenges

<!--How do they interact with technology? -->
<!--What are their typical behaviors, preferences, and struggles?-->

Luna needs access to GPU clusers where she can remotely run and monitor her experiments in a scalable and parallelizable manner. Importantly, she does not want to have to create a custom model training and evaluation framework, instead preferring to reuse existing tools or infrastructure for this (e.g. MLflow for experiment tracking). She sees value in both command line and more interactive tools that provide a UI. She also needs tools to help her with more fine-grained model assessment, e.g. discovering hidden data clusters that might be affecting model performance.

## Working Environment

<!--What environment are they performing their mission in?-->
<!--What OS? System tybe? Classification level?-->
<!--What other tools are they using? How must other tools integrate with them?-->

Luna prefers the Linux OS with tools such as VSCode for coding in Python. She is also familiar with other deep learning frameworks such as Tensorflow, as well as Jupyter notebooks for development. She works primarily with unclassified data (and sometimes CUI data).

## Relevant JATIC Tools

<!--Which JATIC tools or functionalities may be of interest to them?-->

* ML T&E Platform
* Model Analysis (e.g. saliency maps)
* Model Cards
* Metrics Computation
