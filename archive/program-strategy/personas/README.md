# Personas

## Roles - Target user types

The software developed within our program will support a number of different types of users within the AI Lifecycle. We call types of users, "roles". These are documented in the [Roles.md document within this repo](Roles.md).

## Roles vs Personas

Personas are specific manifestations of the roles into concrete individuals. 
Each persona should be associated with a role.

Our personas, with their particular background, missions, and operating environments, help provide a clear perspective and unique voice for the different types of customers that we are supporting. 

Ideally, the overall target user base should be *represented* within our personas. That is, our personas span a broad range of the AI use cases, mission environments, and technical backgrounds which we would like our tools to support. 

## Organization of Documents

- All roles desired for personas should be documented in the [Roles.md document](Roles.md). Currently, these roles are fixed across the program. If it becomes necessary to have different definitions of roles for different teams, raise the issue for discussion.
- Program personas are found in the folder Program_Personas. These personas are owned and maintained by the program. These are held in Mural and linked to from [Program_Personas/program_personas.md](Program_Personas/program_personas.md).
- Personas owned and maintained by product development teams can be found in the folder Product_Team_Personas. Each personas should have the name of the team owning and maintaining that persona in the name of the file.
