# Contributing

To help create a well-maintained and useful set of documentation for the program, we highly encourage contributions, including content modifications, suggestions, and (especially) additions. 

The main ways to contribute are to create an issue or contribute content directly.

### Creating an issue

You can [create an issue](https://gitlab.jatic.net/jatic/internal-docs/-/issues) to do any of the following:

- Suggest additional content that would be helpful
- Request a change or improvement 
- Report a bug or mistake 

### Contributing directly

You can contribute to the project directly by [opening a merge request](https://gitlab.jatic.net/jatic/internal-docs/-/merge_requests) on Gitlab. 

We recommend creating a new branch for your development and opening a merge request when you are satisfied. Your merge request will be reviewed by maintainers and integrated into the docs when approved!

!!! note

    If you plan to dedicate significant effort for a given merge request, consider first opening an issue to discuss what you want to add or change.
