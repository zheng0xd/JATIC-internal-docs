# Contributing

In order to create a well-maintained, central, and useful set of documentation for the program, we highly encourage contributions to this project, including content modifications, suggestions, and (especially) additions. 

The main ways to contribute are by creating an issue or contributing content directly.

### Creating an issue

[Create an issue](https://gitlab.jatic.net/jatic/internal-docs/-/issues) for any of the following:

- Suggesting additional content or pages that would be helpful to the program
- Requesting a change or improvement 
- Reporting a bug or documentation issue 

### Contributing directly

You can contribute to the project directly by [opening a merge request](https://gitlab.jatic.net/jatic/internal-docs/-/merge_requests) on Gitlab. 

We recommend creating a new branch for your development and opening a merge request when you are satisfied. Your merge request will be reviewed by maintainers and integrated into the docs when approved!

!!! note

    If you plan to dedicate significant effort for a given merge request, consider first opening an issue to discuss what you want to add or change.
