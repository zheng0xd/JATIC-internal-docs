# Software Development Process

The program creates many different software products across a large, multi-organizational team-of-teams. In order to develop interoperable software and facilitate productive collaboration, the program follows [Essential Scale Agile Framework (SAFe)](https://scaledagileframework.com/essential-safe/) as its software development methodology. We closely adhere to the roles, artifacts, events, and principles defined by Essential SAFe.

Within this framework, our program is defined as a single [Agile Release Train](https://scaledagileframework.com/agile-release-train/) constituted of several [agile teams](https://scaledagileframework.com/agile-teams/). 

Within our program, each agile team is typically a single organization, developing a standalone product. While these products ultimately need to be complimentary in scope and operate interoperably, the standalone nature of each product greatly simplifies interdependencies and integration. 

In this section, we outline the roles, events, practices, and principles that constitute our shared software development process.
