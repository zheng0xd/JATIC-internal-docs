- Provide a central location to learn about all products within the program.
- Provide program reference materials, such as the program board, increment calendar, and program org chart
- Provide a hosting platform for demos recordings and presentations
- Provide a common reference for the program's standards and requirements, both technical and programmatic, in order to facilitate collaboration across our team-of-teams and create interoperable products
