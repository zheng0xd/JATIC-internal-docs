This is the central location for all internal documentation within the JATIC program.

The primary audience for this documentation is those who are working on the program, including developers, scrum masters, project managers, etc.

The main objectives of this documentation are the following:

- Provide helpful resources for those who are joining the program, such as the [Onboarding Guide](support/onboarding/).
- Provide a central location to learn about the products within the program.
- Provide a common reference for the program's standards, processes, and requirements, both technical and programmatic
- Provide program materials, such as the program board, increment calendar, and org chart
- Provide a hosting platform for demos recordings and presentations

The documentation is maintained by the program management team. Relevant contributions from across the program are strongly encouraged!
