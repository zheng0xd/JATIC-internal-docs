# Capability Overview

!!! warning

    This page is under construction!

Our program provides several categories of products.

- **Python libraries for AI T&E**: Each of these libraries is a standalone product, narrowly scoped to a particular aspect of AI T&E. The lightweight and flexible nature of these libraries allows for easy deployment into your environment and integration into your MLOps pipeline. 
- **A source of common types**: The `maite` library provides common types and protocols for AI objects such as models, datasets, and metrics. These types allow the development of seamless, synergistic workflows using multiple tools.
- **An AI T&E Platform**: `RAVEN` is a data science platform for AI T&E, providing best-in-class open-source MLOps capabilities in an easy-to-deploy package. It may be particularly relevant for teams who have not already adopted an MLOps pipeline.

!!! note
    
    Which products are most relevant to your team will depend on your existing AI T&E pipeline, AI use case, testing requirements, mission requirements, etc. 

    With multiple products and product offerings in the program (each of which can standalone or operate together) you are able to tailor your AI T&E capabilities to fit your requirements.
