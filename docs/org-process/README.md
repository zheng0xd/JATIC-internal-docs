# Organization and Processes

This repo will be used to store [living documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_document) pertaining to the organization and processes within the JATIC program. 

For non-markdown documents (e.g., .pptx and .xlsx files), PDFs are created for easier viewing in gitlab.
