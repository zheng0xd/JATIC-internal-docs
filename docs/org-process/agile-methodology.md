# Agile Software Development Methodology

## Introduction

The JATIC Program follows a basic Scaled Agile approach [(Essential SAFe)](https://scaledagileframework.com/essential-safe/). The defining attribute of SAFe is a  reliance on a series of rolling-wave, short-term commitments from Teams that are delivered upon and revised in an iterative cycle called a Program Increment (PI).

There are Program-level events that take place over the course of the PI. There are also individual Team-level events that take place within the PI. These two levels of events are complimentary and non-duplicative. For instance, Program-level planning events may inform, but do not replace, Team-level planning events (and vice versa).

The Program follows a 2-week Team Sprint cadence, with Sprints starting on Wednesday morning and ending 14 days later on Tuesday night. There are 6 Sprints, plus one smaller Innovation and Planning (IP) Sprint, in each PI.

## Program-level events

### Integration
A key event that focuses on integrating various components or features of a software project. It typically occurs towards the end of a sprint or release cycle and involves a series of tests, such as integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing, to ensure that the software meets the desired quality standards. The team responsible for integrating different pieces of the software work together to ensure that everything is working as expected and that the final product meets the requirements of the stakeholders. The Integration Event is led by the Scrum Master or an Integration Engineer who coordinates the efforts of the team.

### Scrum of Scrums
An important event that enables effective communication and collaboration among multiple Scrum teams working on a large-scale project. It typically takes place at regular intervals, such as weekly or bi-weekly, and is led by a designated Scrum Master. During the meeting, representatives from each team gather to discuss their progress, identify dependencies, and share information on potential roadblocks and solutions. The Scrum of Scrums provides an opportunity for teams to collaborate and coordinate their work effectively, ensuring that all members are aligned towards the same goal and that the project is progressing in the right direction. It also helps to identify and mitigate any potential issues early on, reducing the risk of delays or quality issues further down the line.

## Team-Level Events

The following events are minimum expectations for each Team's internal Sprint cycles. There will be no micromanaging of Team activities by Program Management; Team leadership is expected to ensure that the events occur with frequencies and timeboxes that best suit the Team.

### Sprint Planning (Day 1)

- **Default Attendees:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Technical SMEs, Development Team
- **Inputs:** Team Objectives, Filled and Prioritized Issue Tickets, Feedback from latest Sprint Review
- **Outputs:** Committed set of Issues

At the beginning of the Sprint, the Team comes together to decide on the Sprint's activities. The quantity of activities is based on the Team's capacity. The subject matter of activities is informed by the Team's top prioritized Issues. Issue priorites are based on a combination of the Team Objectives committed to at the start of the PI, feedback from the previous Sprint Review, and the Product Vision maintained by the Product Owner.

**Tips**
1. A well-maintained Backlog resulting from active Product Ownership can ensure this event is quick and easy. If the session tends to take more than an hour, more proactive Backlog Grooming is likely needed.
2. Rather than "pushing" Issues onto Development Team members with direct assignments, consider queing up Issues for the Sprint without an assignee and letting the Development Team members "pull" in Issues as they are available. More detail on this approach can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CostXs2p6r0).
3. Any activity that takes away from the Development Team's capacity should be captured as an Issue with an appropriate Weight, including technical debt or general program support.

### Daily Stand-up (Day 2-13)
Since this is a large project and few if any are fully assigned to it, its unlikely we will actually have daily standups at the JATIC or CDAO/Vendor collaboration levels.

Typically, this happens every day during the sprint, preferably in the morning. The team members come together to discuss their progress since the last stand-up, their plans for the day, and any obstacles they're facing. This meeting should be brief, typically lasting no longer than 15 minutes. 

### Sprint Review (Day 14)
Happens at the end of the sprint, on Tuesday. The team presents the work they've completed during the sprint to stakeholders, who can provide feedback. The team discusses what went well, what didn't go well, and what they can improve in the next sprint.

### Sprint Retrospective (Day 14)
Occurs after the Sprint Review. The team comes together to reflect on the sprint and identify areas for improvement. The team discusses what went well, what didn't go well, and what they can do differently in the next sprint.

### Backlog Refinement (Day 7+)
An ongoing process throughout the sprint, where the team reviews and updates the product backlog. The product owner and team collaborate to refine and prioritize the backlog items based on the feedback received from the stakeholders during the sprint review. 

This may be a formalized meeting.
