# Common Platforms

Common platforms with collective adoption are critical for facilitating collaboration, coordination, information sharing, and situational awareness across a large, multi-organizational team-of-teams. Thus, the program requires the usage of the below platforms for its work as much as is securely and practically possible.

## Communication

The program's communication platform is Slack. Teams should ensure that they are quickly reachable within Slack and should use it for program communications as much as is securely possible. 

See [Slack details TBD]() for more details

## Project management

The program's platform for information sharing, planning, and collaboration is the JATIC Gitlab. 

Teams should use Gitlab for program information sharing, planning, and collaboration. All work items and planning artifacts, including items in the backlog, active work in progress items, larger epics, and roadmaps, should be tracked in Gitlab.

In order to provide transparency of work, all of the above should be easily viewable by the larger program in order to provide transparency of work. This information should be **visible, accessible, and understandable** - meaning that other team members can locate it, access it, and recognize the content, context, and applicability of it. 

## Code repository

The program's platform for code storage and CI/CD is the JATIC Gitlab. 

All code, documentation, and other artifacts created within the program should be avaiable in Gitlab, in order to enable testing against software requirements within the the CI/CD pipeline.

Similar to the above section, all code and documentation should be easily viewable by the larger program in order to provide transparency of work.
