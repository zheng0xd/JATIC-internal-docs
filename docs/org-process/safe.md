# Agile Framework & Principles

The program creates many different software products across a large, multi-organizational team-of-teams. In order to develop interoperable software and facilitate productive collaboration, the program follows [Essential Scale Agile Framework (SAFe)](https://scaledagileframework.com/essential-safe/) as its software development methodology. We closely adhere to the roles, artifacts, events, and principles defined by Essential SAFe.

Within this framework, our program is defined as a single [Agile Release Train](https://scaledagileframework.com/agile-release-train/) constituted of several [agile teams](https://scaledagileframework.com/agile-teams/). 

Within our program, each agile team is typically a single organization, developing a standalone product. While these products ultimately need to be complimentary in scope and operate interoperably, the standalone nature of each product greatly simplifies interdependencies and integration. 

In the following pages, we outline the roles, events, and practices that constitute our shared software development framework. 

In the section below, we highlight three foundational agile principles which are most critical to success within our program's context.

## Critical agile principles

### Inter-organizational collaboration

Products within our program involve multiple teams, each with different areas of expertise, experience, and focus. While each team within the program is developing their own products, there will often still exist areas of overlap and ambiguity between efforts, as well as areas for synergy and collaboration. 

In order to be successful, teams must work collaboratively, directly connecting with each other in order to share progress, find areas of synergy, and collaborate on products. In particular, teams will not allow the program to become a bottleneck in communication or collaboration with other teams (as it often can in government programs).

### Continuous learning and improvement

Continuous learning and improvement is a generic algorithm by which a team can successfully adapt to a wide variety of changing conditions. 

This principle is particularly important within our program's government context, where agile patterns may be very unfamiliar, and our program's technological context, where the world of AI/ML is advancing extremely rapidly.

### Iterative value delivery

Products should not be made for their own sake, rather, they should be aimed at delivering value by meeting the needs and requirements of the customer. Teams must organize their work around value delivery and impact towards this customer.

Furthermore, iterative delivery presents opportunities for discovery of and reprioritization to customer requirements, as well as opportunities for inter-team collaboration. Teams must deliver in-progress work items iteratively, in order to receive feedback from the customer, government, and larger program, as well as to allow greater opportunity for collaboration and coordination with other teams.
