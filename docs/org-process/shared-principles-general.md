# CDAO A2 Division Shared Principles

## Introduction

### Purpose

The CDAO Assessment & Assurance (A2) Division is constituted of a large number of diverse organizations. In order to facilitate productive collaboration, this document establishes a set of shared principles for all work within our multi-organizational team. 

In addition to these general principles, we have also developed a set of principles that specifically apply to software development projects, in [Shared Principles for Software Development](./shared-principles-software.md).

### Request

All teams supporting CDAO A2 will review this document and raise any concerns, questions, or comments with the division as necessary. After discussion, revision, and/or establishment of further clarifying procedures, organizations will commit to following these common principles in their work with the division.

## Shared principles for A2 projects

### Inter-organization collaboration

Projects within the A2 division will involve multiple teams, each with different areas of expertise and focus. 

While the government will delineate areas of focus for each organization, there will often still exist areas of overlap and ambiguity between efforts, as well as areas for synergy and collaboration. 

Teams will work to proactively identify these areas and directly connect with each other in order to share progress, find areas of synergy, and collaborate on products. In particular, teams will not let the government to become the bottleneck in communication or collaboration with other teams. 

In the situation when focus areas or tasks must be clarified or delineated in order to move forward, teams will proactively escalate to the government for a decision.

### Organize around iterative value delivery

Products should not be made for their own sake; rather, they should be aimed at delivering value by meeting the needs and requirements of the end customer. Teams will organize their work around value delivery and impact towards the end customer. 

Iterative delivery presents opportunities for discovery of and reprioritization to customer requirements, as well as opportunities for inter-team collaboration. Teams will deliver in-progress work items iteratively, in order to receive feedback from the customer, government, and larger division, as well as to allow greater opportunity for collaboration and coordination with other teams. While there is no universal rule for delivery cadence, teams will strive to reduce their cycle time for value delivery.

### Use of common platforms

Shared platforms with collective adoption and usage are critical for facilitating collaboration, coordination, information sharing, and situational awareness across a large, multi-organizational team.

The preferred communication platform for the division is Slack. Teams will ensure that they are quickly reachable within Slack and will use it for division communications as much as is securely possible. The preferred platform for information sharing, intra-division planning, and collaboration is Gitlab. Teams will use Gitlab for division information sharing, planning, and collaboration as much as is securely possible. 

Project-specific communications and collaboration platforms should default to these, but may deviate when necessary to accommodate project-specific needs, such as security.

### Use of common processes and standards

Similar to shared platforms, the use of common processes and standards are critical for facilitating collaboration, coordination, information sharing, and situational awareness.

The government will also specify common processes and standards across the division. These will include processes for higher-level strategic alignment, such as a synchronized portfolio planning / review process, as well as mundane processes for daily tasks, such as common processes and standards for meeting scheduling, support tickets, out-of-office indicators, or information organization. 

Teams will align with these processes and standards. In addition (and more importantly), teams will work to provide feedback and continuously improve on these common division processes and standards in order to become a more effective team.

### Transparency of work

Transparency of work is critical to facilitating information discovery and situational awareness across a large, multi-organizational team.

Teams will make artifacts, code, and documentation transparent to the entire A2 division as much as is securely possible. Teams will also make plans and ongoing work priorities, including roadmaps, epics, and issues, transparent to the entire A2 division as much as is securely possible. 

Information that is made available to other teams should be **visible, accessible, and understandable** - meaning that other team members can locate it, access it, and recognize the content, context, and applicability of it.
