# Team-level Events

In order to develop and deliver software, the SAFe approach uses a series of recurring, short-term commitments for teams that are delivered upon and revised within a program increment. To set commitments and objectives for development, the program requires that each team establishes a set of recurring sprint events. 

This document outlines the team-wide events that take place across a program increment. There are also program-level events that take place. These two levels of events are complimentary and non-duplicative. For example, the program-level planning events should help inform team-level planning events. 

These events closely follow Essential SAFe.

## Sprint cadence

The program follows a biweekly cadence for its short-term planning. We call each of these periods a *sprint*. Sprints start on a Wednesday morning and end on a Tuesday night. 

### Example sprint calendar

| DAY 1 - WED | DAY 2 - THU | DAY 3 - FRI | DAY 4 - MON | DAY 5 - TUE | DAY 6 - WED | DAY 7 - THU | DAY 8 - FRI | DAY 9 - MON | DAY 10 - TUE |

## Sprint Planning (Day 1)

### Details

- **Attendees:** Product owner, scrum master, development team
- **Inputs:** Refined and prioritized backlog, team objectives, feedback from latest sprint review
- **Outputs:** Committed set of issues, committed sprint goals
- **Recommended time:** 1 hour

### Description

Sprint planning is a meeting held at the beginning of each sprint where the team comes together to decide on the sprint's objectives and make commitments to the work that will be completed within the sprint.

Commitments made during sprint planning are based on the team's capacity and the team's top prioritized issues. These issues are prioritized by the team's overall increment objectives, any feedback from previous sprints, and the overall product vision (maintained by the product owner). 

An example meeting agenda for sprint planning may be the following:

- Determine the work capacity of the team, considering travel, leave, etc.
- Review prioritized and refined backlog issues
- Estimate issue weights 
- Create the sprint goal(s)
- Commit to issues and goal(s) for the sprint

To read more about sprint planning, see the [Iteration Planning from SAFe](https://scaledagileframework.com/iteration-planning/).

### **Tips**

1. A well-maintained backlog resulting from active product ownership can ensure this event is quick and easy. If the session tends to take more than an hour, more proactive backlog refinement is likely needed.
2. Rather than "pushing" Issues onto development team members with direct assignments, consider queing up issues for the Sprint without an assignee and letting the development team members "pull" in issues as they are available. 
3. Any activity that takes away from the development team's capacity should be captured as an issue with an appropriate Weight, including technical debt or general program support.

## Daily stand-up (Day 2 - 13)

### Details

- **Attendees:** Product owner, scrum master, development team
- **Inputs:** Progress, blockers
- **Outputs:** Any follow-ups to resolve blockers
- **Recommended time:** 15 minutes or less

### Description

The daily stand-up is a time for team members to discuss their progress since the last stand-up, their plans for the day, and any obstacles they're facing. 

A stand-up typically happens every day during the sprint, preferably in the morning. However, if team members are only partially allocated to the program, an every-other day stand-up may be sufficient.

## Backlog Refinement (~Day 7)

### Details

- **Attendees:** Product owner, scrum master, representatives from development team
- **Inputs:** Feedback from latest sprint review, Any adjustments to priorities or scope
- **Outputs:** Prioritized, refined, and fleshed out issues in product backlog
- **Recommended time:** 30 mins - 1 hour

### Description

Backlog refinement is a meeting where the team collaboratively review, refine, prioritize, and flesh out issues within the product backlog. It is informed by any feedback received from stakeholders during the sprint review, any adjustments to scope or priorities at the program or team level, and any technical considerations which have become clear.

For a refined issue, the team should have a good understanding of its technical dependencies and difficulty, its estimated time, its priority, and how it contributes to the team's objectives. By collaboratively bringing the team together for backlog refinement, the team is best able to develop a shared, holistic, and accurate understanding of an issue.

## Sprint review (Day 14)

### Details 

- **Attendees:** Product owner, scrum master, development team, relevant stakeholders
- **Inputs:** Completed issues from sprint and demonstrations of their functionality, sprint goals
- **Outputs:** Stakeholder, product owner, and team feedback on demoed functionality 
- **Recommended time:** 30 minutes - 1 hour

### Description

Sprint review is a meeting held at the end of each sprint where the development team demonstrates the work completed during the sprint. 

The product owner begins the meeting by reviewing the sprint goals and their status. Next, the development team runs through the issues that were committed to for the sprint and the assigned team member demonstrates its functionality. The product owner must decide whether the work completed meets the acceptance criteria, or if any further work is nededed. If there are incomplete issues, the team should reflect on them to identify risks, blockers, and/or any opportunities for improvement. The team also discuss any issues or challenges that arose during the sprint and how they were resolved.

Stakeholders may be invited to provide feedback on the completed work and suggest any changes or enhancements that could be made.

## Sprint retrospective (Day 14)

### Details

- **Attendees:** Product owner, scrum master, development team
- **Inputs:** Sprint goals
- **Outputs:** Continuous improvement issues
- **Recommended time:** 30 minutes - 1 hour

### Description

Sprint retrospective is a meeting held at the end of each sprint where the team comes together to reflect on the sprint and identify areas for improvement. The team discusses what went well, what didn't go well, and what they can do differently in the next sprint.

The iteration retrospective is a difficult meeting to facilitate! They often can be much more effective when structured and facilitated through a validated process. We highly recommend reading more about the sprint retrospective at [Iteration Retrospective from SAFe](https://scaledagileframework.com/iteration-retrospective/) for more details.
