# Slack Usage

## Background

The JATIC program has a indepedent slack workspace, hosted by MITRE. All members of the workspace are related to or supporting the CDAO T&E Division.

## Impact level

The slack workspace is NOT approved for CUI. Please do not post CUI in the slack workspace.

## Joining the workspace

Users can join the workspace in two ways.

1. If you have an existing slack account, you can be invited to the CDAO T&E workspace through that email. This will add the CDAO T&E workspace to your existing account.
2. If you do not have an existing slack account, you can be invited to create a [MITRE Partnership Account](https://mpn.mitre.org/). After creating this account, you can be invited to the CDAO T&E workspace through that email. The MPN account will serve as the single-sign-on for Slack.

## Channels

Anyone can create channels, both public or private. Feel free to do so for your team or working groups. 

Anyone can join any public channel. If you make a public channel, you should expect this.

## Direct messages

Please restrict direct messages to those within the CDAO T&E workspace. 

Because the workspace is hosted by MITRE, members are able send messages to people on MITRE Slack outside of the program. Please do NOT do that, or InfoSec will get upset. Be careful that you only message who you are trying to message. If you are not sure whether someone is in the program, check out the [org chart](https://gitlab.jatic.net/jatic/docs/org-process/-/blob/main/Organization%20Chart.md)!

## Status

Using slack status messages is a very lightweight way to increase situational awareness of team status for cross-team collaboration. 

A few recommendations for usage:

- While you are on leave, set your slack status to :palm_tree: **On vacation**, or something similar. 
- When you have planned upcoming leave, set your slack status to :calendar: **Planned leave from ___ to ___**

## Automated workflows

Our Slack workspace has automated workflows for asychronous meeting updates. On an automated schedule, the workflow sends a message, inviting those to reply with their updates.

### For #cdao-scrum-of-scrums

This workflow is currently set to message at 12:00 PM EST every Thursday in the #cdao-scrum-of-scrums channel.

Each product team should provide an update within the automated thread.
