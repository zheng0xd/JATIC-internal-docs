# Shared Platforms

Shared platforms with collective adoption are critical for facilitating collaboration, coordination, information sharing, and situational awareness across a large, multi-organizational team-of-teams. 

Our program uses the following platforms for its work as much as is securely and practically possible.

## Communication

Our program's communication platform is Slack. Teams should ensure that they are quickly reachable within Slack and should use it for program communications as much as is securely possible. 

## Code

Our program's platform for code storage and CI/CD is the JATIC Gitlab. Teams should use Gitlab for all code, documentation, and other artifacts created within the program, in order to enable continuous testing against software requirements. In order to provide transparency of work, all of the above should be easily viewable by the larger program. 

!!! info

    Work that is transparent should be **visible, accessible, and understandable** - meaning that others can *locate it, access it, and recognize the content, context, and applicability of it*. 

## Project management

### Team-level planning

Our program's platform for team-level planning and project management is the JATIC Gitlab. Teams should use Gitlab for program information sharing, sprint planning, and collaboration. All work items, including items in the backlog, active work in progress items, and larger epics, should be tracked in Gitlab.

Similar to code, all work items should be easily viewable by the larger program in order to provide transparency of work. 

### Program-level planning

Our program's platform for program-level planning is MURAL, because of its excellent collaborative virtual whiteboarding features. Our major increment planning artifacts, including [program boards](https://miro.com/templates/safe-program-board/) and [ROAM boards](https://miro.com/templates/safe-roam-board/), will be created and continually updated on MURAL.
