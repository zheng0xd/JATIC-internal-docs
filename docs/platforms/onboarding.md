# Onboarding

## Slack

Users can join the workspace in two ways.

1. If you have an existing slack account, you can be invited to the CDAO T&E workspace through that email. This will add the CDAO T&E workspace to your existing account.
2. If you do not have an existing slack account, you can be invited to create a [MITRE Partnership Account](https://mpn.mitre.org/). After creating this account, you can be invited to the CDAO T&E workspace through that email. The MPN account will serve as the single-sign-on for Slack.
