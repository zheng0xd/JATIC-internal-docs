# Slack Usage

Our program uses Slack as the preferred means of communication within the program. Teams should use Slack for their communications as much as is securely possible, including text communication and voice communication.

Our Slack workspace can be reached at [https://cdaote.slack.com](https://cdaote.slack.com) and is hosted by MITRE. All members of the workspace work within or support the CDAO Assessment & Assurance (A2) Division. However, the workspace is also used for other projects and programs within the division which are not the JATIC program.

## Joining the workspace

A request to the the Slack workspace can be made for yourself or made by a team member on your behalf. If you have already successfully joined Gitlab, you can make a request for yourself.

1. Create an issue ticket within [`jatic/support`](https://gitlab.jatic.net/jatic/support/-/issues/new#) using the "onboarding" template. 
1. Under the "Slack onboarding" section, add your:
    1. First name
    1. Last name
    1. Email
    1. List of the slack channels you need to be added to (keep blank if unsure)
    1. Onboarding date (set today if unsure)
1. You will receive an email asking you to create a [MITRE Partnership Network Account](https://mpn.mitre.org/), which will serve as your single sign-on for Slack.
1. After creating this account, you will be asked invited to the Slack workspace. 

After successfully logging into your account, you will be required to set up 2FA. 

## Channels

### Default channels

- `#announcements` is used for program-wide annoucements, such as releases, program events, outages, etc. 
- `#general` is used for general discussion, including questions, coordination, technical dicussion, sharing relevant articles, etc. 
- `help` is used for technical support, onboarding support, and troubleshooting.

### Creating channels

Any member of the Slack workspace can create channels, both public or private. Please feel free to do so for your team or working groups. 

Any member of the Slack workspace can join any public channel. If you make a public channel, you should expect this.

## Helpful features

### Slack status

Because our program is consituted of many teams and organizations, we lack shared calendars for tracking leave and travel.

Updating your status in Slack is a lightweight method to share information and increase situational awareness across the program. 

A few recommendations for usage:

- When you have planned upcoming leave, set your Slack status to `:calendar: Planned leave from ___ to ___`, or something similar.
- While you are on leave, set your Slack status to `:palm_tree: On vacation`, or something similar. 

### Automated workflows

Within the Slack workspace, we can set up automated workflows for asychronous meeting updates. On a pre-deterimend schedule, the workflow sends a message, inviting those to reply with their update. This can be useful for meetings such as the daily stand-up or scrum of scrums.

Please send a request in the `#help` channel if you would like to set up a workflow.

## Security

### Impact level

The Slack workspace is NOT approved for Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Please do not post CUI into Slack. All information which is shared on Slack must be below CUI level. 

For reference, our work within the JATIC program is generally below CUI, with some exceptions.

### Direct messages outside of the workspace

Since our Slack workspace is hosted by MITRE, members are able send messages to people on MITRE Slack outside of the program. **Please do not do this**; please restrict direct messages to those within our program.

With all other members of the program, you should have a shared workspace called `CDAO Test & Evaluation`. You can view your shared workspaces with another user within their profile.
