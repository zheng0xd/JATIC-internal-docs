The Government shall have **government purpose rights**Â over the source code, technical data, and artifacts created from a contract within the program.

These shall be all items necessary to compile, test, secure, deploy, and operate the software, including:

- all appropriate documentation, including setup guides, reference architectures, interface control documents, and example use cases

## Inclusion of proprietary software

Program contracts shall stipulate that proprietary software cannot be included in the delivery, or required for full functionality without prior government approval.
