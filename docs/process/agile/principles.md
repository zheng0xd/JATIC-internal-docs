# Key Principles

We highlight three foundational agile principles which are most critical to success within our program's context.

## Inter-organizational collaboration

Products within our program involve multiple teams, each with different areas of expertise, experience, and focus. While each team is developing their own products, there will often exist areas of overlap and ambiguity between efforts, as well as areas for synergy and collaboration. 

In order to be successful, teams must work collaboratively, directly connecting with each other in order to share findings, discover areas of synergy, and collaborate on products. In particular, teams should not allow the government to become a bottleneck in communication or collaboration with other teams (as it often can in government programs).

## Continuous learning and improvement

Continuous learning and improvement is a generic pattern of behavior by which a team can successfully adapt to a wide variety of changing conditions. 

This principle is particularly important within our program's government context, where agile patterns are often unfamiliar, and our program's technological context, where developments in AI/ML are quickly advancing.

## Iterative value delivery

Products should not be made for their own sake, but rather should be aimed at delivering value by meeting the needs and requirements of the customer. Teams must organize their work around value delivery and impact towards this customer.

Furthermore, iterative delivery presents opportunities for discovery of and re-prioritization to customer requirements, as well as opportunities for inter-team collaboration. Teams must deliver in-progress work items iteratively, in order to receive feedback from the customer, government, and larger program, as well as to allow greater opportunity for collaboration and coordination with other teams.
