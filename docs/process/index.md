# Shared Processes &nbsp; :material-account-group:

Our program creates many different software products across a large, multi-organizational team-of-teams. While it is inherently challenging to keep organized and coordinated across such a team, it's ultimately necessary to deliver capability at scale.

This section documents the shared processes, constructs, and tools that we use within the program to help us collaborate. It also contains guides for common activities across the program, such as user engagement.

!!! note

    The items documented in this section are both technical and organizational. They include common methods of team organization, synchronized sprints, and usage of shared platforms.

!!! tip

    This is a helpful section to read if you're just joining the program!
