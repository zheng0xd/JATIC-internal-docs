# Products

## MAITE (Modular AI Trustworthy Engineering)

MAITE is a library of common types, protocols (a.k.a. structural subtypes), and utilities for test and evaluation of supervised machine learning models. 

Its goal is to streamline the development of Python projects by ensuring seamless, synergistic workflows when working with MAITE-conforming Python packages for different test and evaluation tasks. MAITE is designed to be a low-dependency, frequently-improved Python package that is installed by projects.

## Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART)

Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) is a Python library for Machine Learning Security. 

ART provides tools that enable developers and researchers to defend and evaluate Machine Learning models and applications against the adversarial threats of Evasion, Poisoning, Extraction, and Inference. ART supports all popular machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, MXNet, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, GPy, etc.), all data types (images, tables, audio, video, etc.) and machine learning tasks (classification, object detection, speech recognition, generation, certification, etc.).

```
pip install adversarial-robustness-toolbox
```

## Armory

Armory is a pure Python library which allows the measurement of ML systems in the face of adversarial attacks. It takes the years of experience gained and techniques discovered under the [DARPA GARD program](https://www.gardproject.org/) and makes it available to the general user.

## XAITK - Saliency

The Explainable AI Toolkit (XAITK) contains a variety of tools and resources to help users, developers, and researchers understand complex machine learning models. 

The `xaitk-saliency`` package is an open source, XAI framework for visual saliency algorithm interfaces and implementations, built for analytics and autonomy applications. This package was originally developed under the [DARPA XAI program](https://www.darpa.mil/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence).

```
pip install xaitk-saliency
```

## Natural Robustness Toolkit (NRTK)

The `nrtk`` package is an open source toolkit for evaluating the natural robustness of computer vision algorithms to various perturbations, including sensor-specific changes to camera focal length, aperture diameter, etc. Functionality is provided through [Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern) and [Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) patterns to allow for modular integration into systems and applications.

## Data-Analysis Metrics Library (DAML)

The Data-Analysis Metrics Library, or DAML, focuses on characterizing image data and its impact on model performance across classification and object-detection tasks.

**Model-agnostic metrics that bound real-world performance**
- relevance/completeness/coverage
- metafeatures (data complexity)

**Model-specific metrics that guide model selection and training**
- dataset sufficiency
- data/model complexity mismatch

**Metrics for post-deployment monitoring of data with bounds on model performance to guide retraining**
- dataset-shift metrics
- model performance bounds under covariate shift
- guidance on sampling to assess model error and model retraining

## Gradient

Gradient is a Python library for programmatic data visualization and report generation of T&E results. Gradient provides a suite of pre-defined metrics visualizations in order to jump-start reporting and reduce the time from metrics generation to final report. These visualizations and reports can be used to craft a T&E story, as well as gain visibility into data problems or model weaknesses.

## RAVEN

RAVEN is a Computer Vision Model Test & Evaluation Platform using best-in-class Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS). 

It provides a secure, collaborative, and scalable compute environment replete with industry standard machine learning (ML) tools and workflows for rapid analysis of big data sets. RAVEN is designed to be rapidly deployed across cloud, on-prem, air-gapped and edge environments. 

RAVEN is built on the Nebari platform.
