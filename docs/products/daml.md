# Data-Analysis Metrics Library (DAML)

The Data-Analysis Metrics Library, or DAML, focuses on characterizing image data and its impact on model performance across classification and object-detection tasks.

- Model-agnostic metrics that bound real-world performance
  - relevance/completeness/coverage
  - metafeatures (data complexity)
- Model-specific metrics that guide model selection and training
  - dataset sufficiency
  - data/model complexity mismatch
- Metrics for post-deployment monitoring of data with bounds on model performance to guide retraining
  - dataset-shift metrics
  - model performance bounds under covariate shift
  - guidance on sampling to assess model error and model retraining
