# Gradient

Gradient is a Python library for programmatic data visualization and report generation of T&E results. Gradient provides a suite of pre-defined metrics visualizations in order to jump-start reporting and reduce the time from metrics generation to final report. These visualizations and reports can be used to craft a T&E story, as well as gain visibility into data problems or model weaknesses.
