# Gradient

Gradient is a Python library for programmatic data visualization and report generation of T&E results. 
Gradient provides a suite of pre-defined metrics visualizations in order to jump-start reporting and reduce the time from metrics generation to final report. 
These visualizations and reports can be used to craft a T&E story, as well as to gain insight into data problems or model weaknesses.

## Contributing and Feedback

- If you need a bugfix/improvement or have an idea for one, we recommend creating a GitLab issue on the (internal) [Gradient](https://gitlab.jatic.net/jatic/morse/gradient/-/issues/new) or [Gradient RAI](https://gitlab.jatic.net/jatic/morse/gradient-rai/-/issues/new) repos; this allows the discussion to be captured in an easy-to-find location, refer to lines of code easily, etc.
- If you've already written a bugfix/improvement, we recommend creating a GitLab MR:  [Gradient](https://gitlab.jatic.net/jatic/morse/gradient/-/merge_requests/new) or [Gradient-RAI](https://gitlab.jatic.net/jatic/morse/gradient-rai/-/merge_requests/new).
- If you have a question about how to use Gradient or Gradient RAI, a suggestion, or other questions, we recommend using the [#colab-morse](https://mitre.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C05FXQANCG3) channel on slack to start a discussion.
