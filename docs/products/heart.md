# Hardened Extension Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (HEART) 

HEART is a Python extension library for Machine Learning Security that builds on the popular Adversarial Robustness algorithms in ART. The extension library allows the user to leverage core ART algorithms, while providing additional benefits to the AI Test & Evaluation (T&E) engineer: 

-Support for T&E of models for DoD use cases 
-Alignment to MAITE protocols for seamless T&E workflows 
-Essential subset of adversarial robustness methods for targeted AI security coverage 
-Assessment quality assurance in the form of metadata 
-In-depth support for users in the form of guides and examples 
-Front-end application for low-code users: HEART Gradio Application
