# MAITE (Modular AI Trustworthy Engineering)

MAITE is a library of common types, protocols (a.k.a. structural subtypes), and utilities for test and evaluation of supervised machine learning models.

Its goal is to streamline the development of Python projects by ensuring seamless, synergistic workflows when working with MAITE-conforming Python packages for different test and evaluation tasks. MAITE is designed to be a low-dependency, frequently-improved Python package that is installed by projects.
