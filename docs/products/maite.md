# MAITE (Modular AI Trustworthy Engineering)

MAITE is a library of common types, protocols (a.k.a. structural subtypes), and utilities for test and evaluation of supervised machine learning models.

Its goal is to streamline the development of Python projects by ensuring seamless, synergistic workflows when working with MAITE-conforming Python packages for different test and evaluation tasks. MAITE is designed to be a low-dependency, frequently-improved Python package that is installed by projects.

## Contributing and feedback

As MAITE is still in the alpha development phase, end-user experience and internal testing are incredibly valuable to us in revising the protocols.

- If you need a bugfix/improvement or have an idea for one, we recommend [creating a GitLab issue](https://gitlab.jatic.net/jatic/cdao/maite/-/issues/new) on the (internal) MAITE repo; this allows the discussion to be captured in an easy-to-find location, refer to lines of code easily, etc.
- If you've already written a bugfix/improvement, we recommend [creating a GitLab MR](https://gitlab.jatic.net/jatic/cdao/maite/-/merge_requests).
- If you have a question about how to use the current protocols or other questions, we recommend using the [#maite](https://mitre.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C05HBQXEQP3) channel on slack to start a discussion.
- We're also currently working on a "governance" plan to standardize our process of incorporating user feedback going forward.
