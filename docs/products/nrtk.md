# Natural Robustness Toolkit (NRTK)

The `nrtk` package is an open source toolkit for evaluating the natural robustness of computer vision algorithms to various perturbations, including sensor-specific changes to camera focal length, aperture diameter, etc. Functionality is provided through [Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern) and [Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) patterns to allow for modular integration into systems and applications.
