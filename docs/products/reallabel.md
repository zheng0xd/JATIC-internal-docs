# RealLabel

RealLabel is a Python library for AI-Assisted Label Quality Assurance. 
RealLabel allows for more efficient re-labeling efforts by pointing out imagery where there may be labeling issues.
It can find potentially extraneous labels, missing labels, and mis-classified labels.

## Contributing and Feedback

- If you need a bugfix/improvement or have an idea for one, we recommend [creating a GitLab issue](https://gitlab.jatic.net/jatic/morse/reallabel/-/issues/new) on the (internal) RealLabel repo; this allows the discussion to be captured in an easy-to-find location, refer to lines of code easily, etc.
- If you've already written a bugfix/improvement, we recommend [creating a GitLab MR](https://gitlab.jatic.net/jatic/morse/reallabel/-/merge_requests/new).
- If you have a question about how to use RealLabel, a suggestion, or other questions, we recommend using the [#colab-morse](https://mitre.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C05FXQANCG3) channel on slack to start a discussion.
