# Design Principles

This page explains the design principles by which products within the program are chosen and developed.

- **Wide interoperability**: Our products work naturally with each other, with common ML frameworks, and with common MLOps platforms.
- **Straightforward deployment**: Users can easily deploy our products into their own environments, whether its a local machine, on-prem server, cloud server, or HPC. 

*[HPC]: High-Performance Computing

- **Extremely accessible and easy-to-use**: Technical users with limited AI/ML experience can quickly come up to speed on our products, enabled by excellent documentation and highly usable software.
- **Stable, mature, and secure**: Our products bring high levels of software stability, maturity, and security in order to be used within enterprise settings.
- **Validated**: Outputs from our products are validated in order to be used to support high-consequence T&E activities.
- **Open-source**: Our products both build upon and contribute to the open-source community. No licenses, no vendor lock-in, no reinventing the wheel.

!!! warning

    Some of these design principles are aspirational! There are current products within the program that fail to meet some of these criteria.
