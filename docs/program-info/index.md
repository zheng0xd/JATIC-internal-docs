# About the program

The Joint AI T&E Infrastructure Capability (JATIC) program develops software products for AI Test & Evaluation (T&E) and AI Assurance. 

We aim to provide products that address the following key gaps:

- Resilience, robustness, and explainability of AI models
- Reproducibility and traceability of AI experiments
- Interoperability, security, and maturity of AI T&E software
- Documentation and ease-of-use for DoD testers

The program is managed by the Assessment & Assurance Division of the DoD Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO). It is funded from funded from FY23-FY29.
