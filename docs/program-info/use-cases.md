# Supported Use Cases

The JATIC program is currently focused on developing AI T&E capabilities for computer vision (CV) classification and object detection tasks. The libraries and tools that the program are building are designed to be applicable across mission use cases that employ these types of AI algorithms. In particular, the primary mission use cases which we are focused on are:

1. Satellite imagery - CV Object Detection
1. UAV imagery - CV Object Detection
1. Autonomous driving - CV Object Detection
1. Medical imagery - CV Classification

These should not preclude application to other tasks, but serve as the primary missions that guide our development.

For the above missions, we are working with DoD mission-owners to apply our tools into their T&E workflows. For each of the above use cases, we select an open-source dataset which "represents" the mission to serve as our working target. Often, we use these datasets within our development and demos.
