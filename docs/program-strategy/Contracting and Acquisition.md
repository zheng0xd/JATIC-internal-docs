# Contracting, Acquisition

## Competition strategy (Modular contracting approach)

JATIC will follow a modular contracting approach, heavily leveraging the Agile software development contracting strategy within DoD 5000.87. Discrete needs of JATIC will be be contracted separately in smaller increments, rather than a single contract that will provide all needs. The main categories of work within the JATIC effort will be:

1. Development of JATIC software, including creation, productization, and hardening
1. Cloud environments for software integration and test, including creation of DevSecOps environment
1. Personnel for system administration, capability test, capability integration, and other activities

Of the three, the large majority of funding will go towards (1) Development of JATIC software. The development of JATIC software will be further divided and awarded within smaller contracts, split by technical dimensions of AI T&E, which are discussed within the Capability description. Each of these dimensions will become discrete software capabilities of the overall JATIC solutions.

## Innovation & evolution

The JATIC program will collaborate with organizations in the DoD doing Science & Technology (S&T) research, including DARPA, DIU, TRMC, and the Service Labs, in order to transition prototype capabilities. In addition, because of the JATIC team's close interactions and feedback loop with AI T&E tool users, the team will inform S&T organizations on critical research directions in order to best meet capability needs.

JATIC will transition prototypes from TRL 5-6 to TRL 8-10 to be made available as mature products across the DoD.

## Contracting strategy

### Contract vehicle

JATIC will use the Tradewind OTA as its primary contracting solution, but will also use other contracting solutions if appropriate for the need, including CDAO's Test and Evaluation Services Blanket Purchase Agreement (T&E BPA). 

JATIC contracts for the development of software will primarily be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts for the development of software products. For a small number of activities, such as the system administration of the DevSecOps environment, JATIC will leverage service contracts.

Contract periods of performance (PoPs) will be short (e.g., 12 months) to align with release and deployment cycles, with extensions to continue development support as needed. Since each of the software capabilities that JATIC will be acquiring is relatively small, CDAO T&E does not plan to use a challenge-based acquisition approach where multiple contracts are awarded contracts to demonstrate competing capabilities towards the same requirements and need. Instead, JATIC will utilize short PoPs, options, and agile reprioritization to continuously allow resource allocation to most effective solutions and pressing capability needs.

### Selection approach

JATIC will use a phased approach to selection in order to accelerate the timeframe of capability delivery.

1. Release RFIs and receive responses from vendors.
1. Perform market research and information obtained through RFI demos
1. Refine requirements and release Call to Industry

CDAO T&E will utilize Oral Presentations of technical proposals, as well as Technical Product Demonstrations as the primary mechanisms for performing vendor evaluation. 

### Agile software contracts

JATIC vendors will leverage an agile software development approach, which is characterized by continuous change and reprioritization of requirements. Thus, JATIC requires flexible contracts that allow the scope and prioritized capability needs to change in order to deliver functional capability. The government, in consultation with government sponsors through the User Agreements, will have full control of prioritizing the product backlog and managing the development process to ensure individual development contracts align with architecture, vision, and other development activities. Contract modifications will not be not necessary to reprioritize, add, or delete Agile requirements from the product backlog.

In order to utilize Agile development approaches along with FFP contracts, the contract will fix award price and period of performance, but not strictly fix project scope (fix time and cost, flexible and continuously updated scope). Contract price will be negotiated by setting a level-of-effort that the contractor should provide over the PoP, using specified hours in specified labor categories. PoP will be short (e.g., 12 months) to align with release and deployment cycles.

Project scope and requirements will be defined in terms of threshold / objective achievement which allow room for flexible reprioritization of requirements while still allowing criteria for clear and unbiased vendor performance evaluation.

### Vendor deliverables

JATIC contracts will include a deliverables list, but will strive to maintain simplicity rather than excess in extensive deliverable requirements.

In order to avoid excessive deliverables documentation, JATIC will:

- Distinguish between high-value documents and those that simply “check the box” or do not contribute to the value or quality of the product being delivered.
- Streamline the format of the required documents as appropriate.
- Work with the decision authorities to align on an incremental and iterative approach to document completion.
- Utilize automated tools and their artifacts as deliverables, including automated test reports of code coverage and security.

### Cost estimates

The software that is developed under JATIC will follow an agile development strategy which fixes contract price and time, while reprioritizing scope dynamically to best meet capability needs, and to build on successful lines of efforts while cutting unsuccessful efforts. The cost estimate for contract prices will be determined by setting a level-of-effort that the contractor should provide over the PoP, using specified hours in specified labor categories. Afterwards, the cost for contract prices will be negotiated with vendors, using the independent cost estimate and labor categories as a basis.
