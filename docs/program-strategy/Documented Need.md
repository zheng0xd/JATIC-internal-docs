# Documented Need

The Joint AI T&E Infrastructure Capability (JATIC) Program is developing an interoperable set of state-of-the-art software capabilities for AI algorithm T&E. It aims to provide a provide a comprehensive suite of integrated testing tools which can be deployed widely across the enterprise to address key T&E gaps while maintaining broad compatibility to common AI frameworks. JATIC will include capabilities for the T&E of AI model performance, cybersecurity, adversarial resilience, robustness, explainability, and bias which will operate in the Computer Vision (CV) modality.

The capability need and requirement for JATIC derives from the

1. *Responsible AI Strategy and Implementation Pathway (RAI S&I Pathway)*, issued by Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks in June 2022
2. *The National Artificial Intelligence Test & Evaluation Infrastructure Capability* *(NAITIC) Interim Report*, issued by CDAO in July 2022

## RAI S&I Pathway

The RAI S&I Pathway documents a series of specific near-term steps for the implementation of the Department's AI ethical principles and Responsible AI Foundational Tenets. Tenet 2 of the S&I Pathway is Warfighter Trust and clearly defines the capability need that JATIC seeks to address. In particular, Tenet 2 charges CDAO T&E, in coordination with OUSD(R&E) and DOT&E, to

    LOE 2.1: BUILD A ROBUST TEVV ECOSYSTEM AND ACCOMPANYING INFRASTRUCTURE TO DEVELOP AND FIELD AI CAPABILITIES SAFELY AND SECURELY.

    LOE 2.1.1: Develop a TEW framework to articulate how test and evaluation (T&E) should be intertwined across an Al capability's lifecycle and pathways for continuous testing and standards for documentation and reporting. Identify synergies between AI T&E and traditional T&E (e.g. effectiveness, suitability, security, safety) to empower programs to streamline T&E efforts. Include guidance for operationalizing RAT principles into testable conjectures for common technologies, mission domains, and uses cases. 

    LOE 2.1.2: Develop or acquire Al-related T&E tools to be used as a resource for Al developers and testers. This AI T&E Toolkit shall draw upon best practices and innovative research from industry and the academic community, as well as commercially available technology where appropriate. The Toolkit will be made widely available to DoD users and shall include:

    1. Tangible, concrete guidance for PMs, testers, and other relevant T&E stakeholders about how to implement RAI T&E throughout a capability's lifecycle;
    2. T&E Master Plan template for AI and a set of templates for test plans;
    3. A library of T&E metrics for AI systems, including metrics for trustworthiness and confidence; and
    4. Necessary tools and technologies required to detect both natural degradation of and adversarial attacks on Al, including those to detect various attacks on AI systems, and that can notify testers or operators when such attacks are occurring. 

    LOE 2.1.3: Create a test range environment and central repository of tools for T&E of Al, linking to existing and emerging equivalent DoD Component environments, that enables easy and continuous testing for DoD testers. Where appropriate, tools that are housed in this environment should comply with DoD Enterprise DevSecOps Reference Designs for portability across the Department.

## NAITIC Interim Report

The NAITIC Interim Report was developed in response to the FY23 Program Decision Memorandum, in which the Deputy Secretary of Defense and CAPE requested more information to support data-driven decisions about AI T&E infrastructure investments at the DoD enterprise level.

    Program Decision Memorandum Terms of Reference (TOR)

    AI T&E capability is critical for responsible development and fielding of autonomous and artificial intelligence systems. DoD must target investments in this area at key gaps, leverage existing infrastructure in government, industry, and academia where possible, and ensure alignment of T&E investments at all levels—from the programs up to the enterprise—with a coherent vision. This study is essential to inform the decision space for AI T&E investments, and the TOR outlines criteria that will be used to evaluate the roadmap’s utility in this regard

The NAITIC Interim report concluded that "there is widespread interest for DoD enterprise-level T&E infrastructure to address the novel and exacerbated challenges posed by the T&E of AI. While programs are currently investing locally in T&E resources… there is still a consistent desire across survey programs for DoD enterprise support."

The JATIC program was specifically designed to meet the capability needs set forth in these documents, and other AI T&E requirements throughout the Department.
