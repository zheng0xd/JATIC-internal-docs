# Intellectual Property, Open-source, Commercial

## Intellectual property strategy

The Government shall have access to have **ownership** of the source code created within JATIC contracts. Exceptions to this policy can be made on a case by case basis and will be clearly spelled out in the contract award. At a minimum, the Government shall have access to all of the source code created within JATIC contracts to support future analysis and use.

Contracts shall stipulate that proprietary software not be included in the delivery, or required for full functionality without Government approval. In the case that the software must integrate with proprietary software after Government approval, the software must be developed in a manner which preserves the modularity and independent functionality of the non-proprietary component.

Software source code, along with all additional artifacts necessary to compile, test, secure, deploy, and operate the software shall be delivered on a regular basis, as agreed upon within the Performance Work Statement. Software also shall be delivered with appropriate documentation, including setup guides, reference architectures, interface control documents, and example use cases. Additionally, deliveries shall specify technical information on the development, build, and operation of the software, including requirements versioning, dependencies, development environment, build automation software, etc. A precise list of required information with in each software delivery shall be listed in the Software Development Plan.

## Open-source solutions

Software designed for T&E requires transparency of code implementation in order to foster trust in the computed results. Thus, the software solutions developed to support JATIC must have source code which is at least openly accessible by the Government.

JATIC will leverage existing open-source solutions as a starting place for some of its components, especially when the open-source components are widely used and recognized. In these cases, JATIC will provide providing productization, maturity, transition, and deployment on top of the existing solution in order provide a mature product across the Department. JATIC will strive to make many of their capabilities publicly available.

## Commercial solutions

JATIC will leverage existing commercial solutions, insofar as the solutions meet the above capability requirement of code accessibility for the Government. JATIC software will generally avoid commercial solutions offering T&E capacities "as a service" in order to maintain transparency of code.
