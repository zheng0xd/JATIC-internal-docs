# About the program

The Joint AI T&E Infrastructure Capability (JATIC) program develops software products for AI Test & Evaluation (T&E) and AI Assurance.

!!! info "Program objective"

    Develop software to **accelerate** and **enable** AI model test and evaluation for DoD testers _in order to_ provide **rigorous assurance** of the effectiveness, robustness, and safety of the DoD's AI-enabled systems.

We aim to provide products that address the following key gaps:

- Multi-dimensional testing of AI models, such as robustness, resiliency, explainability, and competence
- Reproducibility and traceability of AI experiments
- Interoperability, security, and maturity of AI T&E software
- Ease-of-use for AI DoD testers

The program is managed by the Assessment & Assurance Division of the [DoD Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO)](https://www.ai.mil). It is funded from funded from FY23-FY29.
