# About the program

The Joint AI Test Infrastructure Capability (JATIC) program develops software products for AI Test & Evaluation (T&E) and AI Assurance.

!!! info "Program Mission"

    Develop software to accelerate and enable AI model test and evaluation for testers across the Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise, including DoD programs, research laboratories, industry partners, and academia...
    
    *in order to* provide insight on the performance, effectiveness, robustness, and safety of the DoD's AI-enabled systems.

We aim to provide products that address the following key gaps:

- Multi-dimensional testing of AI models, such as robustness, resiliency, explainability, and competence
- Reproducibility and traceability of AI experiments
- Interoperability, security, and maturity of AI T&E software
- Ease-of-use for AI DoD testers

The program is managed by the Assessment & Assurance Division of the [DoD Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO)](https://www.ai.mil). It is funded from FY23-FY29.
