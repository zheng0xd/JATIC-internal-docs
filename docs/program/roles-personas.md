# Supported Roles & Personas

The products developed within our program support a number of different types of users within the MLOps lifecycle. Below are the primary roles that we focus on within development, as well as their characteristics.

=== "AI T&E Engineer"

    The AI T&E engineer, specifically within the DoD, is the primary role that we aim to support. 

    They perform the following activities:

    - Measures performance of models within various settings and contexts
    - Compares performance of models
    - Validates testing data with operational conditions
    - Verifies requirements satisfaction and validates evaluation results
    - Performs quantitative evaluation of risks
    - Explores potential unknown risks
    - Develops summary report of findings
    - Does not participate in model development
    - Often operates as a third-party from both developers or customers

=== "Data Scientist"

    The data scientist is the secondary role that we aim to support after the AI T&E engineer. However, because testing is performed continually during throughout model experimentation and training, many products built specifically for T&E may be relevant. 
    
    The data scientist performs the following activities:

    - Performs exploratory data and model analysis
    - Performs statistical analysis over data
    - Performs feature engineering
    - Performs model experimentation, training, and fine-tuning
    - Uses MLOps pipelines and platforms
    - Calibrates and re-trains models after drift

=== "AI Red Teamer"

    For most products, the AI red teamer is a secondary user group. However, it is an important user group for our adversarial AI capabilities. 

    The AI red teamer performs the following activities:

    - Performs threat analysis 
    - Performs adversarial assessments of AI models
    - Finds system failure models
    - Builds proxy models to approximate real model performance
    - Possess limited model information

## Personas

To supplement above activities and responsibilities, we've created concrete personas, instantiating the roles into characters with backgrounds, preferences, skillsets, missions, and archetypal workflows.
