# Requirements & Guidelines
# :octicons-checklist-24:

This section of the docs goes over the requirements that must be met by all teams in the JATIC program. Additionally, we provide some guidelines, recommendation, and guides. 

All teams must comply with the requirements specified in this documentation, with exception allowed per requirement classification. 

!!! warning "Important"

    These requirements constitute the "strings" that are "attached" to funds. To receive funds from our program to be part of the program, you must fulfill these requirements.


## Philosophy

Our intention is for requirements to be reasonable and feasible. They are not intended to be onerous. They are meant to provide some guardrails against poor development practices and poor final products. They are also meant to ensure some level of consistency across tools created by our program. Some of the requirements are simply "opinions", a choice between several good options for consistency.

The requirements can be changed. If any requirements seem wrong, infeasible, poorly chosen, overly difficult to adhere to, or otherwise cause strife, let program management know. Adding options for requirements is a common response to such issues.

## Requirement Classification

Requirements can be classified roughly as types 1, 2, or 3 requirements:

**Type 1 Requirements.** Strictly required.

**Type 2 Requirements.** Loosely required with allowed exceptions.

**Type 3 Requirements.** These are functionally **recommendations**, not requirements. *They are not required*, unless they are explicitly set as required a team or product, e.g., to remediate some issue.

Teams who fail to comply with **Type 1 requirements** must provide documentation with defensible justification to the program when non-compliance is recognized or discovered. **Type 2 requirements** do not require formal documentation, but rationale should be evident. **Type 3 requirements**, also described as **recommendations** are essentially suggestions that might help. **Recommendations** are provided for reference in case they help a team  struggling with a question.

Each requirement described within this section should be clear as to the type of requirements. If there is any lack of clarity, please reach out to the POC: @akapusta.

## Requirements Overview

Requirements are split into a few categories based on the domain. Each category has its own section of documentation where relevant requirements are defined.

- **[Software Requirements](../sdp/index.md)** These requirements can roughly be described as: follow the software development plan. 
- **[Product Requirements](./product/index.md)** These requirements apply to the product outputs of our program.
- **[Documentation Requirements](./documentation/index.md)** These requirements apply to documentation created to go with your product. 

Teams must comply with all requirements in these requirements sections, according to the classification of each requirement, in order to meet overall program requirements for each team.
