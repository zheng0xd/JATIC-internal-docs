# Product Naming Guidelines

This page establishes guidelines for choosing product names within our program. 

!!! note

    These guidelines do not apply to products which already have well-established names. Those products definitely do not need to be renamed.

## Guidelines

- Our program will run for several years. Product names should thus consider their product's **long-term scope, vision, adoption, and audience**.
- Each product should have a name that is **understandable to a wide audience**.
  - Products developed within the program will be consumed by a [diverse audience](https://jatic.pages.jatic.net/internal-docs/process/guides/user-engagement/), including testers, developers, and researchers from government, open-source, academia, and industry. 
  - To ensure product names are easily understood by this broad community, please avoid using words, acronyms, or phrases that are primarily DoD acronyms (e.g. “CDAO”, “T&E”, and “TEVV”). Phrases which are more self-explanatory or widely used, such as “Test & Evaluation”, are preferred.
- Each product should have a name that can **stand alone**.
  -  Many users will encounter individual products first before learning that they are one piece of our larger toolbox or program.
  - To reduce confusion as users encounter individual products, we prefer that teams do not use “JATIC” within the product name.
- Product names **do not need to be standardized**. 
  - The  program plans to transition numerous products from open-source and research. 
  - Such products with well-established names will not be renamed and there will be no requirements for standardization across the program. 

!!! example

    Some products may be a single word that provides little detail of the actual function (e.g. Gradient, Armory) while others may be more descriptive (e.g. Adversarial Robustness Toolbox, Explainable AI Toolkit).

- Since our primary customers are DoD organizations, please ensure that capability names **do not conflict or overlap** with other DoD programs and products.
