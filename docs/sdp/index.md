The Software Development Plan (SDP) describes the approach, standards, and expectations for the development of software within the JATIC program.

The SDP is designed with three parties in mind: the JATIC project organizers, the developers of JATIC technologies, and the end-users of the JATIC technologies.

For the project organizers, this document aims to to reduce the variability between JATIC projects in terms of their structure, design, quality, and their ability to inter-operate among one another. It also enables the stakeholders to update and automate the enforcement of requirements in a way that is both systematic and scalable.

For developers, this document is meant to simplify the process of creating high-quality Python projects, and to eliminate the need to choose from the many different approaches to packaging, testing, documentation, and the like. Additionally, it will minimize the need for vendors to employ test engineers and CI/CD specialists, by providing guidance for leveraging standardized open source tools for developing robust automated test suites. Lastly, this SDP aims to make transparent and reproducible the quality-assurance and security testing procedures that the stakeholders will be employing such that these requirements can be used to directly drive the development process.

For end-users, this document ensures that JATIC projects are maintained and tested to high standards, and areÂ  interoperable with one another. An end-user that becomes proficient in the APIs and documentation of one JATIC project should find it easier to become proficient with other JATIC projects. Furthermore, end-users should find that JATIC capabilities compose together elegantly in terms of both code ergonomics and in terms of performance.
