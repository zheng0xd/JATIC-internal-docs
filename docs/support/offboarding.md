1. **Ensure knowledge transfer** - To avoid any knowledge or skill gaps, the departing individual should to transfer their knowledge to the person who will be taking their place.
1. **Transfer ownership** - Within Gitlab and Slack, change over any channel, group, or project ownership to other individuals within the team.
1. **Remove mentions from internal documentation** - Remove references to the individual from internal product documentation, as well as the program's organization chart.
