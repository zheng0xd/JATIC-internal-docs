# PM team

The PM team is the core management team for the JATIC program. 

- The CDAO Chief of T&E leads the CDAO's AI T&E policy, tools development, and execution. 
- The Chief Product Owner (CPO) leads the product owners group and coordinates program-wide strategy, plans, and epics. This is primarily at a high-level - the vast majority of epics, features, and their prioritization will be provided by the product owners of the individual products.
- The Chief Engineer facilitates program level processes and execution, drives continuous value delivery, and ensures the technical integration between products. They lead integrated efforts such as the increment demo. They manage the Software Development Plan (SDP) and provide guidance and input to the Systems Engineering team, on topics such as the SDP, DevSecOps, security, infrastructure, and product testing.
- The Scrum of Scrums Master is the scrum master for the scrum of scrums team, facilitating the prioritization and removal of impediments across teams, and continuously improving the effectiveness of the Scrum of Scrums team.
- The AI T&E Expert has a deep technical understanding of the subject matter and domain in order to advise and support the product owners and development teams. Their primary role is the application of the software developed within the program to actual DoD AI algorithms to provide feedback for the team. They will also aid in the development, integration, and deployment of the products as necessary.
- The User Engagement Coordinator helps run and coordinate engagements between the program and users or user stakeholders. Their focus is on program-level engagements, but also aids in coordination of product-level and distributed/democratized engagements.
